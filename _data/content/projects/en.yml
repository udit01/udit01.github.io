        # Unbinding Bodies
        **Unbinding Bodies** explores the complex intersections between human bodies, technology, consciousness, and perception. The exhibition examines the transition from closed to open systems, challenging traditional Western metaphysical frameworks.

        Visitors experience their own senses oscillating between excess and deficiency as they interact with technology through the installation <Extruded Body> (2024). The exhibition also features <â‰ˆ> (2024), a performance work that traces relational encounters between diverse heterogeneous subjects.

            ### Lessons Learned from Applying On-Device AI Models in Refrigerators

            #### 1. Strategic Service Planning for On-Device AI  
            Our project began with implementing food recognition in refrigerators to provide instantaneous feedback to users. We initially deployed comprehensive models but quickly realized the need for optimization. By strategically separating AI models by function and redesigning the system architecture from first principles, we significantly reduced computational costs while enabling additional features.

            This approach delivered two critical advantages: enhanced user experience through millisecond-level response times and product differentiation through capabilities competitors couldn't match with cloud-dependent solutions.

            #### 2. Mastering NPU Optimization  
            Working with Neural Processing Units (NPUs) presented unique challenges that required deep technical expertise. Through iterative refinement, we developed specialized techniques for model optimization including:
            - **Quantization** to reduce model size while preserving accuracy
            - **Knowledge Distillation** to transfer capabilities from larger to smaller models
            - **Architecture modifications** to accommodate NPU-specific constraints

            For layers not natively supported by the NPU, we implemented custom solutions to maintain performance. This process demanded a comprehensive understanding of each network component, ultimately expanding our technical capabilities and expertise.

            #### 3. Data Collection Strategies for Appliance AI  
            We discovered that model performance improved dramatically when we refined our data processing approach. Despite resource constraints, we implemented strategic data collection protocols to maximize efficiency. This included:
            - Distributed collection systems across regional offices
            - Targeted annotation prioritization
            - Continuous data quality improvement

            Our experience highlighted that thoughtful data strategy is as important as model architecture for real-world AI applications.

            #### 4. Cross-Functional Collaboration  
            Developing AI for home appliances required seamless coordination across multiple disciplines. Hardware teams (mechanics, circuits), software teams (applications, servers), UX designers, product planners, quality assurance, marketing, sales, legal, and patent specialists all contributed essential expertise.

            Through intensive collaboration sessions and cross-functional problem-solving, we aligned diverse perspectives to create a cohesive product. This experience enhanced not only my technical skills but also my project management capabilities.

            #### 5. Pioneering New User Experiences  
            Our real-time **On-Device Food Recognition** feature represents a first-of-its-kind innovation not yet matched by competitors. While the initial release required extensive experimentation, we've seen steadily increasing daily active user metrics. Our global monitoring system allows us to analyze usage patterns, identify issues, and continuously improve the service.

            Our vision is to establish cameras as standard components in all refrigerators, creating AI services that seamlessly integrate into users' daily lives while delivering meaningful convenience.
