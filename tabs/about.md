> I am **Udit Jain**, a Computer Vision Engineer Working at Samsung Research, Korea. 

I like building stuff, and work on exciting projects. I think the process of creation is really beautiful where you create order from chaos of the universe, you decrease the entropy locally to make something which was in your mind-space and now in the physical real world. It's like magic. 

Currently I'm working on Samsung's Refrigerator  adding new features leveraging AI, creating the underlying AI models & algorithms for different use-cases. 

Outside work, I like building fun projects, kaggle, reading books, working out and chess.

Feel free to hit me up with any of your project ideas we could work on together.
